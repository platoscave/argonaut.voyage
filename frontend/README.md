# Argonaut frontend

In it's current form Argonaut will not interact with the blockchain. Instead it'll populate a local datastore from a static resource. If you wish to give a Argonaut a go, clone the respository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platoscave/argonaut.voyage.git
```

Make sure your in `argonaut.voyage/frontend`. Then
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
You can now use the app: [Argonaut](http://localhost:3002/)
